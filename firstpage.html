                Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) is a public technical and research university located in Powai in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

IIT Bombay was founded in 1958.[7] In 1961, the Parliament decreed IITs as Institutes of National Importance.[8] A committee formed by the Government of India recommended the establishment of four higher institutes of technology to set the direction for the development of technical education in the country in 1946. Planning began in 1957 and the first batch of 100 students was admitted in 1958.[8] Since its establishment in Powai, the institute has physically expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 2.2 square kilometers.

IIT Bombay is known for its 4 Year, 5 Year & 2 Year programmes for which the entry is through the Joint Entrance Examination â€“ Advanced and Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering. It offers degrees such as: Bachelor of Technology, Four Year Bachelor of Science, Five Year Master of Science, Five Year IDDDP (Inter-Disciplinary Dual Degree Programme), 2 or 3 Year Master of Technology, and a few others. It also has a comprehensive graduate program offering doctoral degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.[8] It currently has a total of 15 academic departments, 20 centres, a school of excellence and four interdisciplinary programs including a Management Program.

The college also has a department dedicated to the study of public policy, the Centre for Policy Studies, which offers postgraduate (Master's in Public Policy), doctoral and postdoctoral level courses in public policy. The Centre has five primary research areas: digital societies, structural inequalities, environment, markets and governance, and technology and society.
